        PickQuick is a movie recommendation platform that lets users quickly
        discover new content tailored to their preferences. Users can filter by
        genres and streaming providers, receive random curated picks from a
        larger pool, and save movies to their personal "To Watch" list. The goal
        is to reduce decision fatigue by giving fast, relevant, and fun
        recommendations without endlessly scrolling through streaming platforms.{" "}
