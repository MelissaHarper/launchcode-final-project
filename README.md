# PickQuick

## Project Overview
![PickQuick Logo](/src/assets/images/PickQuickLogo.png)
**PickQuick**  PickQuick is a movie recommendation platform that lets users quickly discover new content tailored to their preferences. Users can filter by genres and streaming providers, receive random curated picks from a larger pool, and save movies to their personal "To Watch" list. The goal is to reduce decision fatigue by giving fast, relevant, and fun recommendations without endlessly scrolling through streaming platforms.
